# 🧭 Authenticity Compass

Discover truly authentic local gems, not just tourist traps. Authenticity Compass is a mobile application that combines real-world location data with a unique authenticity score and AI-powered insights to help you find and explore places with genuine character.

## ✨ Features

### Authenticity Scoring
A custom algorithm scores places from 0-100 based on factors like being an independent business, establishment age, and local relevance, helping you find genuine spots over tourist-heavy chains.

### Personalized Recommendations
Select your interests (like coffee shops, bookstores, or music venues) to get a curated feed of authentic places near you.

### 🤖 AI-Powered Reviews & Chat (Google Gemini)

- **Dynamic Reviews**: Get an instant, comprehensive review for any place, generated by AI. It analyzes the place's data to give you insights on atmosphere, what to expect, and insider tips.

- **Conversational Chat**: Have a real-time conversation about any place. Ask follow-up questions like "What's the best thing to order?" or "Is it a good place to work from?" and get contextual answers.

### ✈️ Travel Mode
Enable this mode to get proactive notifications about highly authentic, interesting places near you as you explore a new area, even when the app is in the background.

### Intelligent Search
Search for specific places or categories and see results ranked by our authenticity score.

### Seamless Navigation
Get directions to any discovered place instantly through your default maps application.

### User Authentication
Secure sign-up and login functionality powered by Firebase to save your preferences.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project is a full-stack mobile application built with a modern JavaScript toolset.

| Area | Technology |
|------|------------|
| Mobile | React Native via Expo |
| Backend | Node.js with Express |
| APIs | Foursquare Places API for location data • Google Gemini API for AI reviews and chat |
| Auth | Firebase Authentication |
| State | React Context API |
| Navigation | React Navigation |
| Storage | AsyncStorage for on-device preference storage |

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get the application running on your local machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
- npm or yarn
- Expo Go app on your iOS or Android device
- A Foursquare Developer Account and API Key
- A Google AI Studio Account and Gemini API Key

### 1. Backend Setup

The backend server connects to the Foursquare API and runs our authenticity scoring logic.

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   
   Create a `.env` file in the backend directory by copying the example:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Open the new `.env` file and add your Foursquare API Key:
   ```env
   # .env (in backend/)
   FOURSQUARE_API_KEY=fsq3...
   PORT=3000
   ```

4. Run the server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The backend should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### 2. Frontend (Mobile App) Setup

The frontend is the Expo-managed React Native application.

1. Navigate to the root project directory (if you were in backend, go back one level).

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables for Gemini API:
   
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```
   
   Open the new `.env` file and add your Google Gemini API Key. The variable name must start with `EXPO_PUBLIC_`:
   ```env
   # .env (in project root)
   EXPO_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSy...
   ```

4. Connect to your local backend:
   
   - Find your computer's local network IP address
   - Open the `src/services/apiService.js` file
   - Update the `BASE_URL` with your IP address and the backend port (default is 3000)
   
   ```javascript
   // src/services/apiService.js
   const BASE_URL = "http://YOUR_LOCAL_IP_ADDRESS:3000";
   ```

5. Run the Expo development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   expo start
   ```

6. Open the app:
   
   Scan the QR code generated in the terminal with the Expo Go app on your mobile device.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- **Interactive Map View**: Display all recommendations and search results on a map
- **User Profiles & Saved Places**: Allow users to save their favorite authentic discoveries to a profile
- **User-Submitted Reviews**: Let users add their own reviews and ratings to contribute to the authenticity score
- **Photo Integration**: Fetch and display photos for each place from the Foursquare API
- **Advanced Filtering**: Add more filters for results, such as price, opening hours, and specific features
